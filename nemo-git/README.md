## Nemo Git

**Nemo extension for git branch and file info.**

With this extension your Nemo file manager provides an info bar displaying the
current git branch and file changes summary whenever you are in a git
(sub-)folder. Also, there is a new column which shows the file status according
to git. So you can see your current git changes, untracked, new, removed,
renamed files at a glance.

### Installation

The preferred installation method is via your system's package manager.
Manual installation can be done by creating a symlink to the main script
in `nemo-python`'s extension lookup paths which are by default:
`/usr/share/nemo-python/extensions/` or
`~/.local/share/nemo-python/extensions/`.
Restart `nemo` after that.
