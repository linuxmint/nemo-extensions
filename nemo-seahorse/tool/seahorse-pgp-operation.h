/**
 * SeahorsePGPOperation: A way to track operations done via GPGME.
 *
 * - Derived from SeahorseOperation
 * - Uses the arcane gpgme_io_cbs API.
 * - Creates a new context so this doesn't block other operations.
 *
 * Signals:
 *   results: The GPGME results are ready. This is called before
 *            the 'done' signal of SeahorseOperation.
 *
 * Properties:
 *  gctx:  (pointer) GPGME context.
 *  message: (string) message to display instead of from GPGME.
 *  default-total: (guint) When GPGME reports 0 as progress total, use this instead.
 *
 * HOW TO USE:
 * 1. Create a SeahorsePGPOperation with seahorse_pgp_operation_new.
 * 2. You'll be using the gpgme_ctx_t out of the gctx data member.
 * 3. Use one of the gpgme_op_*_start functions to start an operation with gctx.
 * 4. Hand off the operation to seahorse_progress_* functions (which claim
 *    ownership of the operation) to see a progress dialog or status bar.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - Never use with gpgme_op_keylist_start and gpgme_op_trustlist_start.
