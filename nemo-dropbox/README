Building Dropbox Nemo Extension From Source Tarball
--------------------------------------------------

You will need the following packages (or equivalent):

libnautilus-extension-dev

In the nautilus-dropbox dir just do:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

After installing the package you must restart Nemo. You can do that by issuing the following command (note: if you're running compiz, doing so may lock up your computer - log out and log back in instead):

$ killall nemo
