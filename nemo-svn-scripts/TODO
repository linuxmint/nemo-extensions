For version 1.0 no more features will be added. Only bug fixes.

Things to do in future versions:

- add a waiting/progress dialog box while a command is executing

- check the return value of the Subversion commands and show an
error message if appropriate

- implement a wrapper script for the diff command and invoke meld
or similar (see http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd)

- use a proper scripting language like Python instead of bash

- show the return from some of the commands in a list box
(for example the return from info or status)
