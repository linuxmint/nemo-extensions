Nemo Git Scripts v0.3

This is a collection of shell scripts designed for use with Nautilus that allow
for point-and-click manipulation of a Git repository.

See the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

These scripts are based on the SVN Nautilus Scripts 0.9 written by Marius Scurtescu
(http://marius.scurtescu.com/?p=102). They, in turn, are based on the CVS Nautilus
Scripts written by Gavin Brown (http://jodrell.net/projects/nautilus-cvs-scripts)
