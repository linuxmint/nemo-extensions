Description: Context menu comparison extension for Nemo file manager
 Simple context menu file comparison extension for Nemo,
 inspired by the discontinued 'diff-ext' extension. By default it uses
 'meld' to do the comparison and provides "Compare", "Compare to ~/foo/bar"
 and "Compare Later" in Nemo context menu. Using the configurator tool
 you can choose your favourite compare tool for one-on-one, three-way and
 multi-compare situations.
