DontShowAfterReboot: True
DisplayIf: pgrep nemo
Description: Nemo Compare Extension has been installed. Restart of Nemo is needed to make it work properly (hint: 'nemo -q' in terminal). Or if you prefer, a session restart will be more than enough. After restart, a new option will emerge in Nemo context menu. This option lets you compare selected files with your preferred 'diff' tool as well as select files for later comparison.
