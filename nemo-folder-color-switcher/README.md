## Nemo Folder Color Switcher

**Nemo extension for changing folder colors.**

If a theme provides color variations, this extension lets the user choose
between them for one or multiple selected folders from the context menu.

### Installation

The preferred installation method is via your system's package manager.
Manual installation can be done by moving the extension in
`nemo-python`'s extension lookup paths which are by default:
`/usr/share/nemo-python/extensions/` or
`~/.local/share/nemo-python/extensions/`.
Restart `nemo` after that.

Many unnecessary statements were removed.
