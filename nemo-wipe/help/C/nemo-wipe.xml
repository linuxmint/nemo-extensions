      Usually when you delete a file, even when bypassing the trash, it is
      not accessible anymore, but its content still exists on the medium
      that contained it until a new file is written over it.
      Consequently, it can be quite easy to recover it.

      <title>Deletion doesn't affect data</title>
      <para>
        When you delete a file, even when bypassing or emptying the trash,
        you only tell your computer that you don't care anymore about the
        file. The file's entry is removed from the list of existing files
        but the content of the file remains on the storage medium. The data
        will remain there until the operating system reuses the space for
        new data.
      </para>
      <para>
        It could take weeks, months or years before this space get used for
        new data, actually overwriting the content of the deleted file.
        Until then, it is possible to recover the data by reading directly
        on the storage medium. That's a quite simple operation, automated by
        numerous software.

      <title>An answer: overwriting data several times</title>
      <para>
        If you want to make the content of a file really hard to recover,
        you have to overwrite it with other data. But that's not enough. On
        a magnetic hard disk, it is known

        that the content can still be
        recovered by doing magnetic analysis of the hard disk surface. To
        address this issue, it is possible to overwrite the content to be
        deleted several times. That process is called &quot;wiping&quot;.
      </para>
      <para>
        If some sensible files have been already deleted without paying
        attention to this issue, some of their data probably remains on the
        storage medium. It is thus also useful to wipe all the available
        free space of a storage medium.

        This section is quite technical. In a nutshell, there's a lot of
        limitations, so using this tool without setting up a complete
        security policy will probably be useless.

            Temporary files and disks: lots of programs writes temporary and
            backup files. This means that the sensitive data you want do delete
            probably exists in an other form somewhere on your computer;

            swap space: most operating systems could save data they are working

            storage media features: modern storage media often reorganize
            their content, e.g. to spread the writings over the medium or to
            hide defective places to the operating system. Consequently, you
            can't be sure that the actual place occupied by your sensitive data

            journalized file systems: modern file systems log modifications of
            the files to ease recovering after a crash. This could make wiping
            inefficient. The same kind of problem exists with redundant file
            systems (e.g. RAID), file systems that make snapshots or that
            caches data (e.g. NFS). However, only the names of the files are
            logged if you use the default parameters of the standard Linux file

              Overwriting the data 38 times was the algorithm advised by

              on discontinued hardware technologies. It is thus not advised
