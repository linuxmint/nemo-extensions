What is this?
--------------------
nemo-pastebin is an extension for the Nemo file manager, which allows
users to send files to pastebins just a right-click away.

How does it work?
--------------------
Simply: right-click on a file, select «Pastebin» and, if the Internet
connection is active, after few seconds the application will show a
notification and copy the paste URL to your clipboard, allowing you to paste
it in a browser tab, IRC channel or wherever you want.
