directly from the Nemo file manager context menu.

# ✨ Features

## 🎨 **Color-Coded Tags**
Create unlimited tags with custom names and colors. Organize your files visually with a palette that matches your workflow.

## 🖱️ **Context Menu Integration**
Right-click any file or folder to quickly assign or remove tags. Multi-select support makes batch tagging effortless.

## 🔍 **Virtual Tag Folders**
Click on any tag to open a dedicated view showing all tagged files in one place. Files appear as symbolic links, keeping your original directory structure intact.

## 🎯 **Visual Emblems**
Tagged files display color-coded emblems directly on their icons. Multiple tags? No problem — emblems combine elegantly to show up to three tag colors at once.

## 🚀 **Tag Bar Widget**
A sleek horizontal bar beneath Nemo's address bar displays all your tags. Left-click to browse, right-click to manage.

## 🪶 **Lightweight & Private**
All tag data is stored in a simple JSON file in your home directory. No database servers, no cloud sync, no extended attributes on your filesystem.
