nemo-python for Debian
--------------------------

Plugins are loaded by default from two locations:

 /usr/share/nemo-python/extensions - all-user plugin directory
 ~/.local/share/nemo-python/extensions - per-user plugin directory

Sample plugins can be found in /usr/share/doc/python-nemo/examples. To use
them, copy them to one of the locations above and restart nemo--this can
be done gracefully by running 'nemo --quit'.
