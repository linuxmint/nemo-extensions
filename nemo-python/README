libnemo-extension Python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the Nemo extension library.

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

As of nemo-python 0.7.0, scripts are also loaded from $XDG_DATA_DIRS/nemo-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIRS is 
set to).

Try to copy test.py to that directory for an example

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload the python file without
restarting nemo.
