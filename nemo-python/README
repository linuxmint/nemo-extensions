libnemo-extension Python bindings
=================================

These are the Python bindings for the Nemo extension library.
They are built against the Python 3 C API and can load Python 3 scripts.

Scripts are loaded from $XDG_DATA_DIR/nemo-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is 
set to).

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.


Requirements
============

Nemo      2.6.0
Python    3.3
PyGObject 2.28.0


Notes
-----
In order to reload extensions, you need to restart Nemo.
