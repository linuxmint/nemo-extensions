libautilus-extension Python bindings
====================================

These are unstable bindings for the nemo extension library
introduced in Gnome 2.6.

For examples and documentation check the examples sub directory.

As of nemo-python 0.7.0, scripts are also loaded from $XDG_DATA_DIR/nemo-python/extensions,
which includes ~/.local/share and /usr/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is 
set to).

Try to copy test.py to that directory for an example

Requirements
============

Nemo  2.32.0
Python    2.3
PyGObject 2.28.0

Problems
========
It's currently not possible to reload the python file without
restarting nemo. That's a planned feature for future versions
